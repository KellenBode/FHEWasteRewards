## 🌱 Project Overview

Privacy Waste Rewards is a revolutionary blockchain-based environmental incentive system that combines privacy-preserving technology with sustainable waste management. By leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), users can participate in waste classification activities while maintaining complete anonymity and earning encrypted rewards.

## 🔐 Core Concept

**FHE Contract Anonymous Waste Classification Rewards - Privacy Environmental Points System**

Our platform addresses the critical intersection of environmental consciousness and digital privacy. Traditional waste management systems lack proper incentivization and often compromise user privacy. Privacy Waste Rewards solves this by:

- **Anonymous Participation**: Users register anonymously without revealing personal information
- **Encrypted Rewards**: All points and statistics are encrypted using FHE technology
- **Verifiable Impact**: Transparent waste classification without exposing individual behaviors
- **Sustainable Incentives**: Gamified rewards encourage consistent environmental participation

## 🌟 Key Features
